Re-facilitation of access-cycle 
 - causes multiple complains to the contemporary *passage lic.api* 
 - requires additional interfaces to be designed under *lic.base*
  
Until the solution is finalized, 
all suggestions to the original *passage codebase*
 are going to settle here,  in temporary `outgoing` sub-projects. 
 
Here are two parts:

 - `lic.internal.api` for alternative public interfaces
 - `lic.internal.base` for *Spring*-independent classes that are required 
 for the current *Spring*-based implementation of *access cycle*
