Original [Eclipse Passage Project](https://github.com/eclipse/passage)
covers all aspects of product licensing. 
It relies on OSGi framework in its implementation 
and can be perfectly used to implant licensing in an RCP 
or a general OSGi-based application. 

Passage Spring project is intended to provide the same functionality 
for Spring-based applications. 

In this repository two aspects are to be covered:
1. Access cycle porting: core of Eclipse Passage runtime is going to be 
   available for a product created over Spring Framework.
2. Development API: set of tools and handlers for a Spring product developer, 
   which help one to empower license checks on the product utilization.
